# Denoising_Diffusion_Minerl
This research is based on the [MineRL 0.4.4](https://minerl.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.4/) environment, which is based on the popular game Minecraft that provides a realistic, open-world environment containing multiple tasks. In this environment, intelligent agents are required to perform operations such as exploring, resource gathering, tool making and accomplishing diverse tasks. We apply the diffusion model to the MineRL environment, utilizing the powerful generative capabilities of the diffusion model to generate more realistic and varied game scene images, and the conditional diffusion model to generate action sequences for specific game tasks.

We referenced [the Pytorch version of the diffusion model and the conditional diffusion model](https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch?tab=readme-ov-file). But this is [the official TensorFlow version](https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion).
